Privacy Policy for Event Alerts
Last Updated: 6/8/2025

This Privacy Policy explains what data Event Alerts collects, how it's used, and your rights regarding that data. By using the Service, you agree to this policy.

1. Data Collected
We collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to deliver core bot functionality:

Server IDs & Channel IDs – Used to identify where the bot should listen for alerts and where to send notifications.

Message Content & Embeds – Parsed in-memory solely to detect alert triggers from trusted sources.

Role IDs – Used to mention specific roles when sending alert notifications.

User IDs – Only when necessary for tagging or admin-level logging (optional, if implemented).

We do not collect:

Direct message content

Usernames or discriminators

Server member lists

IP addresses or personal information

2. How We Use Data
Data is used only for the following:

To detect and forward important alerts

To tag designated roles when an alert is triggered

To support core bot functionality (e.g., filtering duplicates, avoiding spam)

Data is processed in-memory and is not persistently stored unless explicitly stated for bot configuration (e.g., channel or role IDs saved in config files or databases for user-defined settings).

3. Data Sharing
We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third party. Data may be accessed temporarily for debugging, maintenance, or to resolve reported issues.

4. Data Retention
Real-time message data is processed ephemerally and discarded after use.

Configuration data (e.g., role IDs, channel IDs) is stored only if needed to operate and can be removed by server admins upon request or by removing the bot.

5. Your Rights
As a server admin, you may:

Request deletion of all configuration data related to your server.

Remove the bot at any time to cease all data processing.

To request data removal, please open an issue on our GitHub repository or message the bot developer via Discord.

6. Security
We implement basic industry-standard safeguards to protect your data (e.g., limited access, secure storage of config files). However, no method is 100% secure.

7. Policy Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy. Significant changes will be noted in the bot’s changelog or GitHub repo. Continued use of the Service implies acceptance of the revised policy.

8. Contact
For questions or concerns, please reach out via our GitHub repository or Discord support server (if applicable).

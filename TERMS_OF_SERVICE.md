Discord Bot Terms of Service (Filled Version)
Last Updated: 6/8/2025

Welcome to Event Alerts! By using this Discord bot (the “Service”), you agree to the following terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.

1. Description of Service
Event Alerts is a Discord bot designed to monitor specific channels across various servers for important alerts and send structured notifications by pinging a designated role in your specified home server channel. It helps ensure that users do not miss critical announcements, such as game events, timers, or other relevant notices. The Service is provided “as-is” and may evolve over time.

2. Acceptance of Terms
By inviting or using Event Alerts, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. You must be at least 13 years old to use this Service, in compliance with Discord's Terms of Service.

3. Data Collection & Usage
Event Alerts collects minimal data necessary to operate, including:

Discord User IDs (for role pings)

Server and Channel IDs (to track where to send/receive messages)

Message content (only from alerts and messages detected as relevant by the bot logic)

Embed contents (used for parsing data from specific bots such as Dank Memer)

We do not store or log private user messages, nor do we sell or share any user data with third parties. All data is processed temporarily in-memory unless otherwise stated.

4. Responsibilities of the User
You are responsible for configuring the bot’s permissions and roles properly in your server.

You must ensure that your use of the bot complies with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.

You agree not to use the bot for spam, harassment, or automating malicious behavior.

If you enable the bot to send alerts to a channel or ping a role, you must ensure your community consents to such notifications.

5. Availability and Downtime
The bot’s availability is not guaranteed. We may perform maintenance, push updates, or encounter unexpected issues that could affect uptime. We reserve the right to modify or shut down the Service at any time, without prior notice.

6. Termination
We may remove your access to the Service or remove the bot from your server at our sole discretion, particularly in cases of misuse, abuse, or violation of these Terms.

7. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from the use or inability to use the Service. This includes lost data, missed alerts, or third-party service issues (e.g., missed messages due to Discord outages).

8. Changes to Terms
We may revise these Terms at any time. The most current version will always be available on our GitHub repository. By continuing to use the Service, you agree to the updated Terms.

9. Contact
For questions, bug reports, or concerns about these Terms, please open an issue on our GitHub repository or contact us via Discord.
